# CS 4365 Project: Clarify
Clarify challenges the preconceptions of how a traditional educational forum operates and what
it should provide. We take advantage of the reality of knowledge obsolescence and rejuvenation
to stray from current leaders like Piazza and Ed Discussion, which abandon older, yet important
information while obfuscating current up-to-date resources.
## Milestones
### Milestone 1: Authentication and Enrollment
Integrate Canvas's roster export schema for seamless course setup and user authentication.
#### Mock Canvas Roster Export Data:
Cannot provide any real data for confidentiality, however, anyone with Canvas course access can acquire this file for their course.
